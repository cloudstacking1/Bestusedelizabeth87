            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button onclick="toggleFAQ('faq1', this)">Q1: Do I get a vehicle history report when buying from a used car dealer? <span></span></button>
                <div id="faq1" class="faq-content">Yes—dealerships are required to provide a Buyers Guide and often offer vehicle history reports (e.g., Carfax or AutoCheck) so you can check for accidents, title issues, ownership history, and more. It’s also wise to request an independent inspection for added certainty.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button onclick="toggleFAQ('faq2', this)">Q2: What costs beyond the listed price should I expect? <span></span></button>
                <div id="faq2" class="faq-content">Be sure to ask for the “out-the-door” price, which includes all taxes, registration, dealer fees, and optional add-ons. This helps you avoid unexpected charges like VIN etching or service contracts that many dealers include later in the process.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button onclick="toggleFAQ('faq3', this)">Q3: Can I negotiate the price or finance terms at a used car dealer? <span></span></button>
                <div id="faq3" class="faq-content">Absolutely—dealers expect negotiation. You can often negotiate the sale price, trade-in value, and financing. Being armed with preapproved financing or clear knowledge of what similar vehicles go for gives you better leverage in these discussions.</div>
